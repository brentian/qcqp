# Chordal graph
- An undirected graph $G$ is called chordal (or triangulated, or a rigid circuit) if every cycle of length greater than or equal to four has at least one chord.
  - Non-chordal graphs can always be chordal extended, i.e., extended to a chordal graph, by adding additional edges to the original graph
