	abstract = {We describe an SDP relaxation based method for the position estimation problem in wireless sensor networks. The optimization problem is set up so as to minimize the error in sensor positions to fit distance measures. Observable gauges are developed to check the quality of the point estimation of sensors or to detect erroneous sensors. The performance of this technique is highly satisfactory compared to other techniques. Very few anchor nodes are required to accurately estimate the position of all the unknown nodes in a network. Also the estimation errors are minimal even when the anchor nodes are not suitably placed within the network or the distance measurements are noisy.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new instance library for quadratic programming (QP), i.e., the family of continuous and (mixed)-integer optimization problems where the objective function and/or the constraints are quadratic. QP is a very diverse class of problems, comprising sub-classes ranging from trivial to undecidable. This diversity is reflected in the variety of QP solution methods, ranging from entirely combinatorial approaches to completely continuous algorithms, including many methods for which both aspects are fundamental. Selecting a set of instances of QP that is at the same time not overwhelmingly onerous but sufficiently challenging for the different, interested communities is therefore important. We propose a simple taxonomy for QP instances leading to a systematic problem selection mechanism. We then briefly survey the field of QP, giving an overview of theory, methods and solvers. Finally, we describe how the library was put together, and detail its final contents.},

This paper introduces a new global optimization algorithm for this problem, which combines two ideas from the literature—finite branching based on the first-order KKT conditions and polyhedral-semidefinite relaxations of completely positive (or copositive) programs. Through a series of computational experiments comparing the new algorithm with existing codes on a diverse set of test instances, we demonstrate that the new algorithm is an attractive method for globally solving nonconvex QP.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between the optimal value of a homogeneous quadratic optimization problem and its semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We consider two quadratic optimization models: (1) \${\textbackslash}min {\textbackslash}\{ x{\textasciicircum}* C x {\textbackslash}mid x{\textasciicircum}* A\_k x {\textbackslash}ge 1, k=0,1,{\textbackslash}ldots,m, x{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}\}\$ and (2) \${\textbackslash}max {\textbackslash}\{ x{\textasciicircum}* C x {\textbackslash}mid x{\textasciicircum}* A\_k x {\textbackslash}le 1, k=0,1,{\textbackslash}ldots,m, x{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\$ is either the real field \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ or the complex field \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$, and \$A\_k,C\$ are symmetric matrices. For the minimization model (1), we prove that if the matrix C and all but one of the \$A\_k\$'s are positive semidefinite, then the ratio between the optimal value of (1) and its SDP relaxation is upper bounded by \$O(m{\textasciicircum}2)\$ when \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}={\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$, and by \$O(m)\$ when \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}={\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$. Moreover, when two or more of the \$A\_k\$'s are indefinite, this ratio can be arbitrarily large. For the maximization model (2), we show that if C and at most one of the \$A\_k\$'s are indefinite while other \$A\_k\$'s are positive semidefinite, then the ratio between the optimal value of (2) and its SDP relaxation is bounded from below by \$O(1/{\textbackslash}log m)\$ for both the real and the complex case. This result improves the bound based on the so-called approximate S-Lemma of Ben-Tal, Nemirovski, and Roos [SIAM J. Optim., 13 (2002), pp. 535–560]. When two or more of the \$A\_k\$'s in (2) are indefinite, we derive a general bound in terms of the problem data and the SDP solution. For both optimization models, we present examples to show that the derived approximation bounds are essentially tight.},

We first develop a general conic program relaxation for QCQP based on a matrix decomposition scheme and polyhedral (piecewise linear) underestimation. By employing suitable matrix cones, we then show that the convex conic relaxation can be reduced to a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. In particular, we investigate polyhedral underestimations for several classes of matrix cones, including the cones of rank-1 and rank-2 matrices, the cone generated by the coefficient matrices, the cone of positive semidefinite matrices and the cones induced by rank-2 semidefinite inequalities. We demonstrate that in general the new SDP relaxations can generate lower bounds at least as tight as the best known SDP relaxations for QCQP. Moreover, we give examples for which tighter lower bounds can be generated by the new SDP relaxations. We also report comparison results of different convex relaxation schemes for nonconvex QCQP with convex quadratic/linear constraints, nonconvex quadratic constraints and 0–1 constraints.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with a distributed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) set-up arising in several control applications. Agents of a network aim to minimize the sum of local linear cost functions subject to both individual constraints and a linear coupling constraint involving all the decision variables. A key, challenging feature of the considered set-up is that some components of the decision variables must assume integer values. The addressed MILPs are NP-hard, nonconvex and large-scale. Moreover, several additional challenges arise in a distributed framework due to the coupling constraint, so that feasible solutions with guaranteed suboptimality bounds are of interest. We propose a fully distributed algorithm based on a primal decomposition approach and an appropriate tightening of the coupling constraint. The algorithm is guaranteed to provide feasible solutions in finite time. Moreover, asymptotic and finite-time suboptimality bounds are established for the computed solution. Montecarlo simulations highlight the extremely low suboptimality bounds achieved by the algorithm.},

	abstract = {We consider a non-convex quadratic program (QP) with linear and convex quadratic constraints that arises from a broad range of applications and is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we first prove that the alternative direction method converges to a local solution of the underlying QP problem. We then propose a new branch-and-cut algorithm that finds a globally optimal solution to the underlying QP problem within a pre-specified 𝜖-tolerance by integrating the alternative direction method with semidefinite relaxation and disjunctive cut techniques. We establish the global convergence of the algorithm and estimate its complexity. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively find a globally optimal solution to medium-scale QP instances in which the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix in the objective function is less than or equals 20.},
