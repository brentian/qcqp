  abstract  = {We describe an SDP relaxation based method for the position estimation problem in wireless sensor networks. The optimization problem is set up so as to minimize the error in sensor positions to fit distance measures. Observable gauges are developed to check the quality of the point estimation of sensors or to detect erroneous sensors. The performance of this technique is highly satisfactory compared to other techniques. Very few anchor nodes are required to accurately estimate the position of all the unknown nodes in a network. Also the estimation errors are minimal even when the anchor nodes are not suitably placed within the network or the distance measurements are noisy.},

  abstract   = {This paper describes a new instance library for quadratic programming (QP), i.e., the family of continuous and (mixed)-integer optimization problems where the objective function and/or the constraints are quadratic. QP is a very diverse class of problems, comprising sub-classes ranging from trivial to undecidable. This diversity is reflected in the variety of QP solution methods, ranging from entirely combinatorial approaches to completely continuous algorithms, including many methods for which both aspects are fundamental. Selecting a set of instances of QP that is at the same time not overwhelmingly onerous but sufficiently challenging for the different, interested communities is therefore important. We propose a simple taxonomy for QP instances leading to a systematic problem selection mechanism. We then briefly survey the field of QP, giving an overview of theory, methods and solvers. Finally, we describe how the library was put together, and detail its final contents.},

  abstract   = {We present a decomposition-approximation method for generating convex relaxations for nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). We first develop a general conic program relaxation for QCQP based on a matrix decomposition scheme and polyhedral (piecewise linear) underestimation. By employing suitable matrix cones, we then show that the convex conic relaxation can be reduced to a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. In particular, we investigate polyhedral underestimations for several classes of matrix cones, including the cones of rank-1 and rank-2 matrices, the cone generated by the coefficient matrices, the cone of positive semidefinite matrices and the cones induced by rank-2 semidefinite inequalities. We demonstrate that in general the new SDP relaxations can generate lower bounds at least as tight as the best known SDP relaxations for QCQP. Moreover, we give examples for which tighter lower bounds can be generated by the new SDP relaxations. We also report comparison results of different convex relaxation schemes for nonconvex QCQP with convex quadratic/linear constraints, nonconvex quadratic constraints and 0–1 constraints.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between the optimal value of a homogeneous quadratic optimization problem and its semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We consider two quadratic optimization models: (1) \${\textbackslash}min {\textbackslash}\{ x{\textasciicircum}* C x {\textbackslash}mid x{\textasciicircum}* A\_k x {\textbackslash}ge 1, k=0,1,{\textbackslash}ldots,m, x{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}\}\$ and (2) \${\textbackslash}max {\textbackslash}\{ x{\textasciicircum}* C x {\textbackslash}mid x{\textasciicircum}* A\_k x {\textbackslash}le 1, k=0,1,{\textbackslash}ldots,m, x{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\$ is either the real field \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ or the complex field \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$, and \$A\_k,C\$ are symmetric matrices. For the minimization model (1), we prove that if the matrix C and all but one of the \$A\_k\$'s are positive semidefinite, then the ratio between the optimal value of (1) and its SDP relaxation is upper bounded by \$O(m{\textasciicircum}2)\$ when \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}={\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$, and by \$O(m)\$ when \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}={\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$. Moreover, when two or more of the \$A\_k\$'s are indefinite, this ratio can be arbitrarily large. For the maximization model (2), we show that if C and at most one of the \$A\_k\$'s are indefinite while other \$A\_k\$'s are positive semidefinite, then the ratio between the optimal value of (2) and its SDP relaxation is bounded from below by \$O(1/{\textbackslash}log m)\$ for both the real and the complex case. This result improves the bound based on the so-called approximate S-Lemma of Ben-Tal, Nemirovski, and Roos [SIAM J. Optim., 13 (2002), pp. 535–560]. When two or more of the \$A\_k\$'s in (2) are indefinite, we derive a general bound in terms of the problem data and the SDP solution. For both optimization models, we present examples to show that the derived approximation bounds are essentially tight.},

This paper introduces a new global optimization algorithm for this problem, which combines two ideas from the literature—finite branching based on the first-order KKT conditions and polyhedral-semidefinite relaxations of completely positive (or copositive) programs. Through a series of computational experiments comparing the new algorithm with existing codes on a diverse set of test instances, we demonstrate that the new algorithm is an attractive method for globally solving nonconvex QP.},

In this paper, we first prove that the alternative direction method converges to a local solution of the underlying QP problem. We then propose a new branch-and-cut algorithm that finds a globally optimal solution to the underlying QP problem within a pre-specified 𝜖-tolerance by integrating the alternative direction method with semidefinite relaxation and disjunctive cut techniques. We establish the global convergence of the algorithm and estimate its complexity. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively find a globally optimal solution to medium-scale QP instances in which the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix in the objective function is less than or equals 20.},

This problem spans multiple domains including quantum mechanics and chemistry sciences and we investigate the geometric properties of this optimization problem. Fourth-order optimality conditions are derived for characterizing local and global minima. When the matrix in the quadratic term is diagonal, the problem has no spurious local minima and global solutions can be represented explicitly and calculated in \$\$O(n{\textbackslash}log \{n\})\$\$operations. When A is a rank one matrix, the global minima of the problem are unique under certain phase shift schemes. The strict-saddle property, which can imply polynomial time convergence of second-order-type algorithms, is established when the coefficient \$\${\textbackslash}beta \$\$of the quartic term is either at least \$\$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\})\$\$or not larger than O(1). Finally, the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz exponent of quartic–quadratic problem is estimated and it is shown that the largest exponent is at least 1/4 for a broad class of stationary points.},

  abstract   = {The problem of optimizing a quadratic form over an orthogonality constraint (QP-OC for short) is one of the most fundamental matrix optimization problems and arises in many applications. In this paper, we characterize the growth behavior of the objective function around the critical points of the QP-OC problem and demonstrate how such characterization can be used to obtain strong convergence rate results for iterative methods that exploit the manifold structure of the orthogonality constraint (i.e., the Stiefel manifold) to find a critical point of the problem. Specifically, our primary contribution is to show that the Łojasiewicz exponent at any critical point of the QP-OC problem is 1 / 2. Such a result is significant, as it expands the currently very limited repertoire of optimization problems for which the Łojasiewicz exponent is explicitly known. Moreover, it allows us to show, in a unified manner and for the first time, that a large family of retraction-based line-search methods will converge linearly to a critical point of the QP-OC problem. Then, as our secondary contribution, we propose a stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) method called Stiefel-SVRG for solving the QP-OC problem and present a novel Łojasiewicz inequality-based linear convergence analysis of the method. An important feature of Stiefel-SVRG is that it allows for general retractions and does not require the computation of any vector transport on the Stiefel manifold. As such, it is computationally more advantageous than other recently-proposed SVRG-type algorithms for manifold optimization.},

This paper aims at globally solving the QP where the Hessian matrix of the objective to be minimized has r negative eigenvalues. It is known to be nondeterministic polynomial-time hard even when r = 1. This paper presents a novel algorithm to globally solve the QP for r = 1 and then extends to general r. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms/software for small r.},

On a previous paper we introduced a method called MIQCR for solving QCQPs with the following restriction: all quadratic sub-functions of purely continuous variables are already convex. In this paper, we propose an extension of MIQCR which applies to any QCQP. Let (P) be a QCQP. Our approach to solve (P) is first to build an equivalent mixed-integer quadratic problem (P∗). This equivalent problem (P∗) has a quadratic convex objective function, linear constraints, and additional variables y that are meant to satisfy the additional quadratic constraints y=xxT, where x are the initial variables of problem (P). We then propose to solve (P∗) by a branch-and-bound algorithm based on the relaxation of the additional quadratic constraints and of the integrality constraints. This type of branching is known as spatial branch-and-bound. Computational experiences are carried out on a total of 325 instances. The results show that the solution time of most of the considered instances is improved by our method in comparison with the recent implementation of QuadProgBB, and with the solvers Cplex, Couenne, Scip, BARON and GloMIQO.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem with a nonempty bounded feasible domain. The problem is first transformed into a linear conic programming problem, and then approximated by semidefinite programming problems over different intervals. In order to improve the lower bounds, polar cuts, generated from corresponding cut-generation problems, are embedded in a branch-and-cut algorithm to yield a globally –optimal solution (with respect to feasibility and optimality, respectively) in a finite number of iterations. To enhance the computational speed, an adaptive branch-and-cut rule is adopted. Numerical experiments indicate that the number of explored nodes required for solving QCQP problems can be significantly reduced by employing the proposed polar cuts.},

Using these sets, we derive closed-form formulas to compute intersection cuts which allow for quick cut-computations by simply plugging-in parameters associated to an arbitrary quadratic inequality being violated by a vertex of an LP relaxation.

While recent research has focused on strengthening convex relaxations of QCQP using the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT), the state-of-the-art methods lose their effectiveness when dealing with (multiple) nonconvex quadratic constraints in QCQP, except for direct lifting and linearization. In this research, we decompose and relax each nonconvex constraint to two second order cone (SOC) constraints and then linearize the products of the SOC constraints and linear constraints to construct some new effective valid constraints. Moreover, we extend the reach of the RLT-like techniques for almost all different types of constraint-pairs (including valid inequalities by linearizing the product of a pair of SOC constraints, and the Hadamard product or the Kronecker product of two respective valid linear matrix inequalities), examine dominance relationships among different valid inequalities, and explore almost all possibilities of gaining benefits from generating valid constraints. We also successfully demonstrate that applying RLT-like techniques to additional redundant linear constraints could reduce the relaxation gap significantly. We demonstrate the efficiency of our results with numerical experiments.},

The key ingredients in this construction are a simplicial conic relaxation of S and an S-free set: a convex zone whose interior does not intersect S. Ideally, such S-free set would be maximal inclusion-wise, as it would generate a deeper cutting plane. However, maximality can be a challenging goal in general. In this work, we show how to construct maximal S-free sets when S is defined as a general quadratic inequality. Our maximal S-free sets are such that efficient separation of a vertex in LP-based approaches to quadratically constrained problems is guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to provide maximal quadratic-free sets.},

In this paper, we study more general intersections of the form K ∩ Q and K ∩ Q ∩ H , where K is a SOCr cone, Q is a nonconvex cone deﬁned by a single homogeneous quadratic, and H is an afﬁne hyperplane. Under several easy-to-verify conditions, we derive simple, computable convex relaxations K ∩ S and K ∩ S ∩ H , where S is a SOCr cone. Under further conditions, we prove that these two sets capture precisely the corresponding conic/convex hulls. Our approach uniﬁes and extends previous results, and we illustrate its applicability and generality with many examples.},

A common approach to solve the PRP exactly is through speed discretization, i.e., assuming that speed over each arc is chosen from a prescribed set of values. In this paper, we keep speed as a continuous decision variable within an interval and propose new formulations for the PRP. In particular, we build two mixed-integer convex optimization models for the PRP, by employing tools from disjunctive convex programming. These are the first arc-based formulations for the PRP with continuous speed. We also derive several families of valid inequalities to further strengthen both models. We test the proposed formulations on benchmark instances. Some instances are solved to optimality for the first time.},

In this paper, we follow a second-order cone (SOC) based approach to derive an exact convex reformulation of the TRS under a structural condition on the conic constraint. Our structural condition is immediately satisfied when there are no additional conic constraints, and it generalizes several such conditions studied in the literature. As a result, our study highlights an explicit connection between the classical nonconvex TRS and smooth convex quadratic minimization, which allows for the application of cheap iterative methods such as Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent, to the TRS. Furthermore, under slightly stronger conditions, we give a low-complexity characterization of the convex hull of the epigraph of the nonconvex quadratic function intersected with the constraints defining the domain without any additional variables.

Our first main result shows that if the conic set is bounded, then cut generating functions for integer linear programs can easily be adapted to give the integer hull of the conic integer program. Then we introduce a new class of cut generating functions which are non-decreasing with respect to second-order cone. We show that, under some minor technical conditions, these functions together with integer linear programming-based functions are sufficient to yield the integer hull of intersections of conic sections in R2.},

  abstract = {We study non-convex optimization problems over simplices. We show that for a large class of objective functions, the convex approximation obtained from the Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) admits optimal solutions that exhibit a sparsity pattern. This characteristic of the optimal solutions allows us to conclude that (i) a linear matrix inequality constraint, which is often added to tighten the relaxation, is vacuously satisfied and can thus be omitted, and (ii) the number of decision variables in the RLT relaxation can be reduced from \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\} (n{\textasciicircum}2)\$\$to \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\} (n)\$\$. Taken together, both observations allow us to reduce computation times by up to several orders of magnitude. Our results can be specialized to indefinite quadratic optimization problems over simplices and extended to non-convex optimization problems over the Cartesian product of two simplices as well as specific classes of polyhedral and non-convex feasible regions. Our numerical experiments illustrate the promising performance of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Several types of relaxations for binary quadratic polynomial programs can be obtained using linear, secondorder cone, or semideﬁnite techniques. In this paper, we propose a general framework to construct conic relaxations for binary quadratic polynomial programs based on polynomial programming. Using our framework, we re-derive previous relaxation schemes and provide new ones. In particular, we present three relaxations for binary quadratic polynomial programs. The ﬁrst two relaxations, based on second-order cone and semideﬁnite programming, represent a signiﬁcant improvement over previous practical relaxations for several classes of non-convex binary quadratic polynomial problems. From a practical point of view, due to the computational cost, semideﬁnite-based relaxations for binary quadratic polynomial problems can be used only to solve small to mid-size instances. To improve the computational eﬃciency for solving such problems, we propose a third relaxation based purely on second-order cone programming. Computational tests on different classes of non-convex binary quadratic polynomial problems, including quadratic knapsack problems, show that the second-order cone-based relaxation outperforms the semideﬁnite-based relaxations that are proposed in the literature in terms of computational eﬃciency and is comparable in terms of bounds.},

  abstract = {A bipartite bilinear program (BBP) is a quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problem where the variables can be partitioned into two sets such that fixing the variables in any one of the sets results in a linear program. We propose a new second order cone representable (SOCP) relaxation for BBP, which we show is stronger than the standard SDP relaxation intersected with the boolean quadratic polytope. We then propose a new branching rule inspired by the construction of the SOCP relaxation. We describe a new application of BBP called as the finite element model updating problem, which is a fundamental problem in structural engineering. Our computational experiments on this problem class show that the new branching rule together with an polyhedral outer approximation of the SOCP relaxation outperforms a state-of-the-art commercial global solver in obtaining dual bounds.},
