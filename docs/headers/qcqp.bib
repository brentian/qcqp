	abstract = {We describe an SDP relaxation based method for the position estimation problem in wireless sensor networks. The optimization problem is set up so as to minimize the error in sensor positions to fit distance measures. Observable gauges are developed to check the quality of the point estimation of sensors or to detect erroneous sensors. The performance of this technique is highly satisfactory compared to other techniques. Very few anchor nodes are required to accurately estimate the position of all the unknown nodes in a network. Also the estimation errors are minimal even when the anchor nodes are not suitably placed within the network or the distance measurements are noisy.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new instance library for quadratic programming (QP), i.e., the family of continuous and (mixed)-integer optimization problems where the objective function and/or the constraints are quadratic. QP is a very diverse class of problems, comprising sub-classes ranging from trivial to undecidable. This diversity is reflected in the variety of QP solution methods, ranging from entirely combinatorial approaches to completely continuous algorithms, including many methods for which both aspects are fundamental. Selecting a set of instances of QP that is at the same time not overwhelmingly onerous but sufficiently challenging for the different, interested communities is therefore important. We propose a simple taxonomy for QP instances leading to a systematic problem selection mechanism. We then briefly survey the field of QP, giving an overview of theory, methods and solvers. Finally, we describe how the library was put together, and detail its final contents.},

	abstract = {We present a decomposition-approximation method for generating convex relaxations for nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). We first develop a general conic program relaxation for QCQP based on a matrix decomposition scheme and polyhedral (piecewise linear) underestimation. By employing suitable matrix cones, we then show that the convex conic relaxation can be reduced to a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. In particular, we investigate polyhedral underestimations for several classes of matrix cones, including the cones of rank-1 and rank-2 matrices, the cone generated by the coefficient matrices, the cone of positive semidefinite matrices and the cones induced by rank-2 semidefinite inequalities. We demonstrate that in general the new SDP relaxations can generate lower bounds at least as tight as the best known SDP relaxations for QCQP. Moreover, we give examples for which tighter lower bounds can be generated by the new SDP relaxations. We also report comparison results of different convex relaxation schemes for nonconvex QCQP with convex quadratic/linear constraints, nonconvex quadratic constraints and 0–1 constraints.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between the optimal value of a homogeneous quadratic optimization problem and its semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We consider two quadratic optimization models: (1) \${\textbackslash}min {\textbackslash}\{ x{\textasciicircum}* C x {\textbackslash}mid x{\textasciicircum}* A\_k x {\textbackslash}ge 1, k=0,1,{\textbackslash}ldots,m, x{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}\}\$ and (2) \${\textbackslash}max {\textbackslash}\{ x{\textasciicircum}* C x {\textbackslash}mid x{\textasciicircum}* A\_k x {\textbackslash}le 1, k=0,1,{\textbackslash}ldots,m, x{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\$ is either the real field \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ or the complex field \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$, and \$A\_k,C\$ are symmetric matrices. For the minimization model (1), we prove that if the matrix C and all but one of the \$A\_k\$'s are positive semidefinite, then the ratio between the optimal value of (1) and its SDP relaxation is upper bounded by \$O(m{\textasciicircum}2)\$ when \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}={\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$, and by \$O(m)\$ when \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}={\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$. Moreover, when two or more of the \$A\_k\$'s are indefinite, this ratio can be arbitrarily large. For the maximization model (2), we show that if C and at most one of the \$A\_k\$'s are indefinite while other \$A\_k\$'s are positive semidefinite, then the ratio between the optimal value of (2) and its SDP relaxation is bounded from below by \$O(1/{\textbackslash}log m)\$ for both the real and the complex case. This result improves the bound based on the so-called approximate S-Lemma of Ben-Tal, Nemirovski, and Roos [SIAM J. Optim., 13 (2002), pp. 535–560]. When two or more of the \$A\_k\$'s in (2) are indefinite, we derive a general bound in terms of the problem data and the SDP solution. For both optimization models, we present examples to show that the derived approximation bounds are essentially tight.},

Through a series of computational experiments comparing the new algorithm with existing codes on a diverse set of test instances, we demonstrate that the new algorithm is an attractive method for globally solving nonconvex QP.},

In this paper, we first prove that the alternative direction method converges to a local solution of the underlying QP problem. We then propose a new branch-and-cut algorithm that finds a globally optimal solution to the underlying QP problem within a pre-specified 𝜖-tolerance by integrating the alternative direction method with semidefinite relaxation and disjunctive cut techniques. We establish the global convergence of the algorithm and estimate its complexity. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively find a globally optimal solution to medium-scale QP instances in which the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix in the objective function is less than or equals 20.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of solving a special quartic–quadratic optimization problem with a single sphere constraint, namely, finding a global and local minimizer of \$\${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}mathbf \{z\}{\textasciicircum}\{*\}A{\textbackslash}mathbf \{z\}+{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}beta \}\{2\}{\textbackslash}sum \_\{k=1\}{\textasciicircum}\{n\}{\textbar}z\_\{k\}{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$\$such that \$\${\textbackslash}Vert {\textbackslash}mathbf \{z\}{\textbackslash}Vert \_\{2\}=1\$\$. This problem spans multiple domains including quantum mechanics and chemistry sciences and we investigate the geometric properties of this optimization problem. Fourth-order optimality conditions are derived for characterizing local and global minima. When the matrix in the quadratic term is diagonal, the problem has no spurious local minima and global solutions can be represented explicitly and calculated in \$\$O(n{\textbackslash}log \{n\})\$\$operations. When A is a rank one matrix, the global minima of the problem are unique under certain phase shift schemes. The strict-saddle property, which can imply polynomial time convergence of second-order-type algorithms, is established when the coefficient \$\${\textbackslash}beta \$\$of the quartic term is either at least \$\$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\})\$\$or not larger than O(1). Finally, the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz exponent of quartic–quadratic problem is estimated and it is shown that the largest exponent is at least 1/4 for a broad class of stationary points.},

	abstract = {The problem of optimizing a quadratic form over an orthogonality constraint (QP-OC for short) is one of the most fundamental matrix optimization problems and arises in many applications. In this paper, we characterize the growth behavior of the objective function around the critical points of the QP-OC problem and demonstrate how such characterization can be used to obtain strong convergence rate results for iterative methods that exploit the manifold structure of the orthogonality constraint (i.e., the Stiefel manifold) to find a critical point of the problem. Specifically, our primary contribution is to show that the Łojasiewicz exponent at any critical point of the QP-OC problem is 1 / 2. Such a result is significant, as it expands the currently very limited repertoire of optimization problems for which the Łojasiewicz exponent is explicitly known. Moreover, it allows us to show, in a unified manner and for the first time, that a large family of retraction-based line-search methods will converge linearly to a critical point of the QP-OC problem. Then, as our secondary contribution, we propose a stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) method called Stiefel-SVRG for solving the QP-OC problem and present a novel Łojasiewicz inequality-based linear convergence analysis of the method. An important feature of Stiefel-SVRG is that it allows for general retractions and does not require the computation of any vector transport on the Stiefel manifold. As such, it is computationally more advantageous than other recently-proposed SVRG-type algorithms for manifold optimization.},

Summary of Contribution: Nonconvex quadratic program (QP) is a classical optimization problem in operations research. This paper aims at globally solving the QP where the Hessian matrix of the objective to be minimized has r negative eigenvalues. It is known to be nondeterministic polynomial-time hard even when r = 1. This paper presents a novel algorithm to globally solve the QP for r = 1 and then extends to general r. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms/software for small r.},

On a previous paper we introduced a method called MIQCR for solving QCQPs with the following restriction: all quadratic sub-functions of purely continuous variables are already convex. In this paper, we propose an extension of MIQCR which applies to any QCQP. Let (P) be a QCQP. Our approach to solve (P) is first to build an equivalent mixed-integer quadratic problem (P∗). This equivalent problem (P∗) has a quadratic convex objective function, linear constraints, and additional variables y that are meant to satisfy the additional quadratic constraints y=xxT, where x are the initial variables of problem (P). We then propose to solve (P∗) by a branch-and-bound algorithm based on the relaxation of the additional quadratic constraints and of the integrality constraints. This type of branching is known as spatial branch-and-bound. Computational experiences are carried out on a total of 325 instances. The results show that the solution time of most of the considered instances is improved by our method in comparison with the recent implementation of QuadProgBB, and with the solvers Cplex, Couenne, Scip, BARON and GloMIQO.},

The problem is first transformed into a linear conic programming problem, and then approximated by semidefinite programming problems over different intervals. In order to improve the lower bounds, polar cuts, generated from corresponding cut-generation problems, are embedded in a branch-and-cut algorithm to yield a globally –optimal solution (with respect to feasibility and optimality, respectively) in a finite number of iterations. To enhance the computational speed, an adaptive branch-and-cut rule is adopted. Numerical experiments indicate that the number of explored nodes required for solving QCQP problems can be significantly reduced by employing the proposed polar cuts.},

While recent research has focused on strengthening convex relaxations of QCQP using the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT), the state-of-the-art methods lose their effectiveness when dealing with (multiple) nonconvex quadratic constraints in QCQP, except for direct lifting and linearization. In this research, we decompose and relax each nonconvex constraint to two second order cone (SOC) constraints and then linearize the products of the SOC constraints and linear constraints to construct some new effective valid constraints. Moreover, we extend the reach of the RLT-like techniques for almost all different types of constraint-pairs (including valid inequalities by linearizing the product of a pair of SOC constraints, and the Hadamard product or the Kronecker product of two respective valid linear matrix inequalities), examine dominance relationships among different valid inequalities, and explore almost all possibilities of gaining benefits from generating valid constraints. We also successfully demonstrate that applying RLT-like techniques to additional redundant linear constraints could reduce the relaxation gap significantly. We demonstrate the efficiency of our results with numerical experiments.},

The key ingredients in this construction are a simplicial conic relaxation of S and an S-free set: a convex zone whose interior does not intersect S. Ideally, such S-free set would be maximal inclusion-wise, as it would generate a deeper cutting plane. However, maximality can be a challenging goal in general. In this work, we show how to construct maximal S-free sets when S is defined as a general quadratic inequality. Our maximal S-free sets are such that efficient separation of a vertex in LP-based approaches to quadratically constrained problems is guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to provide maximal quadratic-free sets.},

In this paper, we study more general intersections of the form K ∩ Q and K ∩ Q ∩ H , where K is a SOCr cone, Q is a nonconvex cone deﬁned by a single homogeneous quadratic, and H is an afﬁne hyperplane. Under several easy-to-verify conditions, we derive simple, computable convex relaxations K ∩ S and K ∩ S ∩ H , where S is a SOCr cone. Under further conditions, we prove that these two sets capture precisely the corresponding conic/convex hulls.

In this paper, we keep speed as a continuous decision variable within an interval and propose new formulations for the PRP. In particular, we build two mixed-integer convex optimization models for the PRP, by employing tools from disjunctive convex programming. These are the first arc-based formulations for the PRP with continuous speed. We also derive several families of valid inequalities to further strengthen both models.

Despite having a nonconvex objective, it is known that the classical TRS and a number of its variants are polynomial-time solvable. In this paper, we follow a second-order cone (SOC) based approach to derive an exact convex reformulation of the TRS under a structural condition on the conic constraint. Our structural condition is immediately satisfied when there are no additional conic constraints, and it generalizes several such conditions studied in the literature. As a result, our study highlights an explicit connection between the classical nonconvex TRS and smooth convex quadratic minimization, which allows for the application of cheap iterative methods such as Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent, to the TRS. Furthermore, under slightly stronger conditions, we give a low-complexity characterization of the convex hull of the epigraph of the nonconvex quadratic function intersected with the constraints defining the domain without any additional variables. We also explore the inclusion of additional hollow constraints to the domain of the TRS, and convexification of the associated epigraph.},

This characteristic of the optimal solutions allows us to conclude that (i) a linear matrix inequality constraint, which is often added to tighten the relaxation, is vacuously satisfied and can thus be omitted, and (ii) the number of decision variables in the RLT relaxation can be reduced from \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\} (n{\textasciicircum}2)\$\$to \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\} (n)\$\$. Taken together, both observations allow us to reduce computation times by up to several orders of magnitude. Our results can be specialized to indefinite quadratic optimization problems over simplices and extended to non-convex optimization problems over the Cartesian product of two simplices as well as specific classes of polyhedral and non-convex feasible regions.

In this paper, we propose a general framework to construct conic relaxations for binary quadratic polynomial programs based on polynomial programming. Using our framework, we re-derive previous relaxation schemes and provide new ones. In particular, we present three relaxations for binary quadratic polynomial programs. The ﬁrst two relaxations, based on second-order cone and semideﬁnite programming, represent a signiﬁcant improvement over previous practical relaxations for several classes of non-convex binary quadratic polynomial problems. From a practical point of view, due to the computational cost, semideﬁnite-based relaxations for binary quadratic polynomial problems can be used only to solve small to mid-size instances. To improve the computational eﬃciency for solving such problems, we propose a third relaxation based purely on second-order cone programming. Computational tests on different classes of non-convex binary quadratic polynomial problems, including quadratic knapsack problems, show that the second-order cone-based relaxation outperforms the semideﬁnite-based relaxations that are proposed in the literature in terms of computational eﬃciency and is comparable in terms of bounds.},

A natural problem in the optimization setting is then to separate a given DNN but non-CP matrix from the cone of CP matrices. We describe two different constructions for such a separation that apply to 5 × 5 matrices that are DNN but non-CP.

This paper studies the discrete moment problems with additional shape constraints that guarantee the worst-case distribution is either log-concave (LC), has an increasing failure rate (IFR), or increasing generalized failure rate (IGFR). These classes of shape constraints have not previously been studied in the literature, in part due to their inherent nonconvexities. Nonetheless, these classes are useful in practice, with applications in revenue management, reliability, and inventory control. We characterize the structure of optimal extreme point distributions under these constraints. We show, for example, that an optimal extreme point solution to a moment problem with m moments and LC shape constraints is piecewise geometric with at most m pieces. This optimality structure allows us to design an exact algorithm for computing optimal solutions in a low-dimensional space of parameters. We also leverage this structure to study a robust newsvendor problem with shape constraints and compute optimal solutions.},

We prove that if the rank of the aggregate sparsity matrix is not less than \$\$n-1\$\$and the matrix remains positive semidefinite after replacing some off-diagonal nonzero elements with zeros, then the standard SDP relaxation provides an exact optimal solution for the QCQP under feasibility assumptions. In particular, we demonstrate that QCQPs with forest-structured aggregate sparsity matrix, such as the tridiagonal or arrow-type matrix, satisfy the exactness condition on the rank. The exactness is attained by considering the feasibility of the dual SDP relaxation, the strong duality of SDPs, and a sequence of QCQPs with perturbed objective functions, under the assumption that the feasible region is compact. We generalize our result for a wider class of QCQPs by applying simultaneous tridiagonalization on the data matrices. Moreover, simultaneous tridiagonalization is applied to a matrix pencil so that QCQPs with two constraints can be solved exactly by the SDP relaxation.},

We demonstrate its applicability in integer programming by providing an alternate derivation of the split cut for mixed-integer polyhedral sets and ﬁnding the convex hull of certain mixed/pure-integer bilinear sets. We then extend the utility of the convexiﬁcation tool to relaxing nonconvex inequalities, which are not naturally disjunctive, by providing sufﬁcient conditions for establishing the convex extension property over the non-negative orthant. We illustrate the utility of this result by deriving the convex hull of a continuous bilinear covering set over the non-negative orthant. Although we illustrate our results primarily on bilinear covering sets, they also apply to more general polynomial covering sets for which they yield new tight relaxations.},

	abstract = {The second-order cone plays an important role in convex optimization and has strong expressive abilities despite its apparent simplicity. Second-order cone formulations can also be solved more efﬁciently than semideﬁnite programming problems in general. We consider the following question, posed by Lewis and Glineur, Parrilo, Saunderson: is it possible to express the general positive semideﬁnite cone using second-order cones? We provide a negative answer to this question and show that the 3 × 3 positive semideﬁnite cone does not admit any second-order cone representation. In fact we show that the slice consisting of 3 × 3 positive semideﬁnite Hankel matrices does not admit a second-order cone representation. Our proof relies on exhibiting a sequence of submatrices of the slack matrix of the 3 × 3 positive semideﬁnite cone whose “second-order cone rank” grows to inﬁnity.},

In this paper, we first show that conventional SDR is generally not tight for the problem. Then, we propose a new and enhanced SDR and show its tightness under an easily checkable condition, which essentially requires the level of the noise to be below a certain threshold. The above results have answered an open question posed by So in [Proceedings of the Twenty-First Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA'10), SIAM, Philadelphia, PA, 2011, pp. 698--711].

In contrast to existing relaxations based on semideﬁnite programming (SDP), our relaxations incorporate features of both SDP and second order cone programming (SOCP) and, as a result, solve more quickly than SDP. A downside is that the calculated bounds are weaker than those gotten by SDP. The framework allows one to choose a block-diagonal structure for the mixed SOCP-SDP, which in turn allows one to control the speed and bound quality. For a ﬁxed block-diagonal structure, we also introduce a procedure to improve the bound quality without increasing computation time signiﬁcantly. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated on a large sample of QCQPs from various sources.},

Normally it is easier to establish the global convergence of a trust region algorithm than that of its line search counterpart.

This problem is a generalization of the Celis--Denis--Tapia (CDT) problem and thus we refer to it as GCDT (Generalized CDT). The CDT problem has been widely studied, but no polynomial-time algorithm was known until Bienstock's recent work. His algorithm solves the CDT problem in polynomial time with respect to the number of bits in data and \${\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ by admitting an \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ error in the constraints. The algorithm, however, appears to be difficult to implement. In this paper, we present another algorithm for GCDT, which is guaranteed to find a global solution for almost all GCDT instances (and slightly perturbed ones in some exceptionally rare cases), in exact arithmetic (including eigenvalue computation). Our algorithm is based on the approach proposed by Iwata, Nakatsukasa, and Takeda (2015) for computing the signed distance between overlapping ellipsoids. Our algorithm computes all the Lagrange multipliers of GCDT by solving a two-parameter linear eigenvalue problem, obtains the corresponding KKT points, and finds a global solution as the KKT point with the smallest objective value. In practice, in finite precision arithmetic, our algorithm requires \$O(n{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log u{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$ computational time, where \$n\$ is the number of variables and \$u\$ is the unit roundoff. Although we derive our algorithm under the unrealistic assumption that exact eigenvalues can be computed, numerical experiments illustrate that our algorithm performs well in finite precision arithmetic.},

In order to illustrate the usefulness of our test, we applied it to two examples that do not satisfy the assumptions required by prior methods. Our test guarantees that there is no optimality gap for the first example---a solution is also computed from the relaxation---and we used it to establish that an optimality gap exists in the second.},

In particular, we ﬁrst prove a general continuity result for the solution set deﬁned by a system of convex quadratic inequalities. This result implies immediately that the optimal solution set of the aforementioned problem is nonempty when all the quadratic functions involved are convex. In the absence of the convexity of the objective function, we give examples showing that the optimal solution set may be empty either when there are two or more convex quadratic constraints, or when the Hessian of the objective function has two or more negative eigenvalues. In the case when there exists only one convex quadratic inequality constraint (together with other linear constraints), or when the constraint functions are all convex quadratic and the objective function is quasi-convex (thus allowing one negative eigenvalue in its Hessian matrix), we prove that the optimal solution set is nonempty.},

However, \${\textbackslash}varphi ( x )\$ is not differentiable, since the eigenvalues are not differentiable at points where they coalesce. In this paper an algorithm that converges to the minimum of \${\textbackslash}varphi ( x )\$ at a quadratic rate is outlined. Second derivatives are not required to obtain quadratic convergence in cases where the solution is strongly unique. An important feature of the algorithm is the ability to split a multiple eigenvalue, if necessary, to obtain a descent direction. In these respects the new algorithm represents a significant improvement on the first-order methods of Polak and Wardi and of Doyle.

In this paper we rediscover this fact and discover its great practicality, which exhibits good performance both in accuracy and eﬃciency. Moreover, we generalize the approach in various directions, namely by allowing for an ellipsoidal constraint, dealing with the so-called hard case, and obtaining approximate solutions eﬃciently when high accuracy is unnecessary. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is a general-purpose TRS solver, eﬀective both for dense and large-sparse problems, including the so-called hard case. Our algorithm is easy to implement: its essence is a few lines of MATLAB code.},

Recently, some authors have studied a certain family of convex sets associated with this problem. We prove several fundamental results concerned with these convex sets: we determine their dimension, characterize their extreme points and vertices, show their invariance under certain aﬃne transformations, and show that various linear inequalities induce facets. We also show that the sets are closely related to the Boolean quadric polytope, a fundamental polytope in the ﬁeld of polyhedral combinatorics. Finally, we give a classiﬁcation of valid inequalities and show that this yields a ﬁnite recursive procedure to check the validity of any proposed inequality.},

	abstract = {Decades of advances in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and recent development in mixed-integer second-order-cone programming (MISOCP) have translated very mildly to progresses in global solving nonconvex mixed-integer quadratically constrained programs (MIQCP). In this paper we propose a new approach, namely Compact Disjunctive Approximation (CDA), to approximate nonconvex MIQCP to arbitrary precision by convex MIQCPs, which can be solved by MISOCP solvers. For nonconvex MIQCP with n variables and m general quadratic constraints, our method yields relaxations with at most O(n log(1/ε)) number of continuous/binary variables and linear constraints, together with m convex quadratic constraints, where ε is the approximation accuracy. The main novelty of our method lies in a very compact lifted mixed-integer formulation for approximating the (scalar) square function. This is derived by ﬁrst embedding the square function into the boundary of a three-dimensional second-order cone, and then exploiting rotational symmetry in a similar way as in the construction of BenTal-Nemirovski approximation. We further show that this lifted formulation characterize the union of ﬁnite number of simple convex sets, which naturally relax the square function in a piecewise manner with properly placed knots. We implement (with JuMP) a simple adaptive reﬁnement algorithm. Numerical experiments on synthetic instances used in the literature show that our prototypical implementation (with hundreds of lines of Julia code) can already close a signiﬁcant portion of gap left by various state-of-the-art global solvers on more diﬃcult instances, indicating strong promises of our proposed approach.},

In this paper we study the structure of the convex hull of a two-term disjunction applied to the second-order cone and develop a methodology to derive closed-form expressions for convex inequalities describing the resulting convex hull. Our approach is based on ﬁrst characterizing the structure of undominated valid linear inequalities for the disjunction and then using conic duality to derive a family of convex, possibly nonlinear, valid inequalities that correspond to these linear inequalities. We identify and study the cases where these valid inequalities can equivalently be expressed in conic quadratic form and where a single inequality from this family is sufﬁcient to describe the convex hull. In particular, our results on two-term disjunctions on the second-order cone generalize related results on split cuts by Modaresi, Kılınç, and Vielma, and by Andersen and Jensen.},
