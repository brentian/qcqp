	abstract = {This paper describes a new instance library for quadratic programming (QP), i.e., the family of continuous and (mixed)-integer optimization problems where the objective function and/or the constraints are quadratic. QP is a very diverse class of problems, comprising sub-classes ranging from trivial to undecidable. This diversity is reflected in the variety of QP solution methods, ranging from entirely combinatorial approaches to completely continuous algorithms, including many methods for which both aspects are fundamental. Selecting a set of instances of QP that is at the same time not overwhelmingly onerous but sufficiently challenging for the different, interested communities is therefore important. We propose a simple taxonomy for QP instances leading to a systematic problem selection mechanism. We then briefly survey the field of QP, giving an overview of theory, methods and solvers. Finally, we describe how the library was put together, and detail its final contents.},

	abstract = {We present a decomposition-approximation method for generating convex relaxations for nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP). We first develop a general conic program relaxation for QCQP based on a matrix decomposition scheme and polyhedral (piecewise linear) underestimation. By employing suitable matrix cones, we then show that the convex conic relaxation can be reduced to a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. In particular, we investigate polyhedral underestimations for several classes of matrix cones, including the cones of rank-1 and rank-2 matrices, the cone generated by the coefficient matrices, the cone of positive semidefinite matrices and the cones induced by rank-2 semidefinite inequalities. We demonstrate that in general the new SDP relaxations can generate lower bounds at least as tight as the best known SDP relaxations for QCQP. Moreover, we give examples for which tighter lower bounds can be generated by the new SDP relaxations. We also report comparison results of different convex relaxation schemes for nonconvex QCQP with convex quadratic/linear constraints, nonconvex quadratic constraints and 0–1 constraints.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between the optimal value of a homogeneous quadratic optimization problem and its semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. We consider two quadratic optimization models: (1) \${\textbackslash}min {\textbackslash}\{ x{\textasciicircum}* C x {\textbackslash}mid x{\textasciicircum}* A\_k x {\textbackslash}ge 1, k=0,1,{\textbackslash}ldots,m, x{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}\}\$ and (2) \${\textbackslash}max {\textbackslash}\{ x{\textasciicircum}* C x {\textbackslash}mid x{\textasciicircum}* A\_k x {\textbackslash}le 1, k=0,1,{\textbackslash}ldots,m, x{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\$ is either the real field \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ or the complex field \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$, and \$A\_k,C\$ are symmetric matrices. For the minimization model (1), we prove that if the matrix C and all but one of the \$A\_k\$'s are positive semidefinite, then the ratio between the optimal value of (1) and its SDP relaxation is upper bounded by \$O(m{\textasciicircum}2)\$ when \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}={\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$, and by \$O(m)\$ when \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}={\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$. Moreover, when two or more of the \$A\_k\$'s are indefinite, this ratio can be arbitrarily large. For the maximization model (2), we show that if C and at most one of the \$A\_k\$'s are indefinite while other \$A\_k\$'s are positive semidefinite, then the ratio between the optimal value of (2) and its SDP relaxation is bounded from below by \$O(1/{\textbackslash}log m)\$ for both the real and the complex case. This result improves the bound based on the so-called approximate S-Lemma of Ben-Tal, Nemirovski, and Roos [SIAM J. Optim., 13 (2002), pp. 535–560]. When two or more of the \$A\_k\$'s in (2) are indefinite, we derive a general bound in terms of the problem data and the SDP solution. For both optimization models, we present examples to show that the derived approximation bounds are essentially tight.},

In this paper, we first prove that the alternative direction method converges to a local solution of the underlying QP problem. We then propose a new branch-and-cut algorithm that finds a globally optimal solution to the underlying QP problem within a pre-specified 𝜖-tolerance by integrating the alternative direction method with semidefinite relaxation and disjunctive cut techniques. We establish the global convergence of the algorithm and estimate its complexity. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively find a globally optimal solution to medium-scale QP instances in which the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix in the objective function is less than or equals 20.},
